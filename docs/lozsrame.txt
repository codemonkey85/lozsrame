| 1.0 Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Legend of Zelda SRAM Editor, or lozsrame for short, is a program that will let
  you edit your save progress in The Legend of Zelda for NES.
  
  The game's own method for saving games was to used a battery backed portion
  of RAM commonly referred to as SRAM (save RAM). Emulators such as Nestopia,
  FCEU, and Nesten create a file with an .sav extention to keep this SRAM data.
  This program is designed to edit these files and allow you to change your game
  data.
  
  Note: this program is an SRAM editor, NOT a save state editor. This program
  will not edit save states. Save states are emulator dependent, while SRAM
  files work with any good NES emulator.

| 2.0 Usage
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  To use this program, you will need two things. First, obviously, is the
  program itself. Precompiled binaries are available for Windows, Linux, and Mac
  OS X. Second is a SRAM file. There is a sample file included with the binary
  distributions, but you will probably want to use the one from your emulator.
  
  You will need to consult your emulator docs for information about where the
  SRAM file is stored, but the most common places are in the emulator's
  directory or your ROM directory. It will be named similar to your ROM, but
  with an .sav extention. For example: Legend of Zelda, The (U) (PRG0).sav.
  
  To open the SRAM, you can either drop the file onto the window, or choose
  open from the file menu. Assuming you opened a valid SRAM file, the program
  will display controls that you can use to edit the games.
  
  By default, the first valid game in the SRAM is opened. You can change this
  from the game menu.
  
  The controls should be more or less obvious. When you are done with your
  changes, you can quit the program. If you have not saved your changes, the
  program will ask you to save before exit.

| 3.0 Source Code
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Binaries are available for Windows (2000 and later), Linux, and Mac OS X
  (Tiger or later). The source is also available if you want to compile it
  yourself.
  
  To compile, you will need a modern C++ compiler and Qt 4.
  
  On most platforms, compiling is as easy as opening a terminal and running
  qmake && make (nmake for Visual Studio, or mingw32-make for mingw). That
  should work on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows.

| 5.1 Credits
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Thanks for Bero and Xodnizel for the wonderful FCEU emulator which I use
  almost exclusively. Thanks also to BBitmaster, Parasyte, and sp for their work
  on FCEUD, FCEUXD, and FCEUXD SP, a great debugging NES emulator which I used
  to find the checksum algorithm and all the values.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  This program only edits your inventory, not the map data. This means if you
  give yourself something you didn't have, you can still find it. This is not
  really a problem, the problem is with taking something away. You will not be
  able to get it back in-game. I may fix this in a future version.
